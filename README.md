PM2.5 visualization for the West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project
Note: This project is far from complete. There are still many optimizations to be made in terms of runtime.
This web application allows a member or volunteer of the West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project to
upload PM2.5 data from a DustTrak II 8530 and corresponding location data from an AMOD GPS Photo Tracker AGL3080
for visualization on an online map viewed by the public. Users can filter points on the map by year, month, or day.
The map was created using the arcGIS JavaScript API, and the basemap was provided by OpenStreetMap.
